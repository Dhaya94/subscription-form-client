### `Features`

User can submit the following details through the form:

- Email
- First Name

The user input is validated, and any errors related to the input are displayed to the user and need to be resolved before the form can be submitted.

Once the form is submitted successfully, the user is shown a success message and allowed to redirect to the form to submit another entry.
